    First:- I created folder called RAN-Group-Project, then  i open that folder in VS-code.
    Second:- Second I opened VS-code terminal and wrote npx create-react-app frontend.
        (i) frontend is folder in which react is created
        (ii) When you guys are downloading this from Git you need to run react commands so you will not have need to install react again

    Third:- I have deleted not required files, I have deleted not required lines in app.js, they were mainly for react server host run page
        (i) Created components folder and created header and footer components
        (ii) imported headed and footer components in app.js

    Fourth:- I am installing bootstrap in react and downloading css ffrom theme to speed up things.
        (i) https://bootswatch.com/ => Darkly => Download => bootstrap.min.css => copying in src folder => importing in index.js
        (ii) https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction =>

    Step 3: Preparing for database connection,
        (i) Please look inside src folder for programmer.js file 
        (ii) This file is temporaily created later all that data is in this file will be inside our django database
        (iii) Creating images folder inside public folder and copying temporaily some images

        (i) Actually consider them as different pages just for understanding purposes
        (ii) Creating file in folder calling it HomeScreen'js
        (iii)Doing rfce in blank file to get react functional component
    
    Step 6: Creating Programmer component (please pay attention here, we are about to understand actual logic of component)
        (i)In componenets folder we are creating new component and it is programmer
        (ii)Now from programmerscreeen we are going to use that component by importing it
        (iii)From programmer screen we are going to send programmer data as props
        (iv)And by doing this we will be able to access all data which is going to come from database
        (v)At the moment I have created teporary data iniside programmer.js file in src folder


    Step 7: Importing react-router-dom in app.js

Implementing Django in our project:-
    First thing for python we need to set up virtual environment.
        -> Quick recap = Please write command pip list
            (i) It will tell us what we have installed insisde our python packages folder.
        -> To install virtaul environement.
            (i) pip install virtualenv {I think in our case its already installed but you can do it again}
            (ii)Setting up virtual env with name RANenv => virtualenv RANenv
            (iii) When I ran above command I have output requirement already satisfied
            (iv) If everything is good then we are going to see RANenv folder next to frontend folder
            (v) Activaitng our Envirionment => RANenv\scripts\activate
            (vi) We will see that we have (RANenv) like this before our folder path
            (vii) Once we see this means our environment is active
            (viii) Please now do pip list command again and you will notice there are a lot less dependices now
    
    Installing following new packages:
        So I am installing all these new packages Robin and Nick have to run below commands,
        So you don't need to install packages by commands, its also important so for reason if we 
        end up with different versions of installations then some of us might see some problems 
        that other don't

            (i) pip install -r requirements.txt {inside RAN folder make sure we are not in frontend folder}
            (ii)npm install packages inside frontend folder
        
        (i)pip install django
        (ii) pip3 freeze > requirements.txt (Going to do this everytime so requirements file is upto date for you guys)
        (iii) django-admin startproject backend
    
    Starting django server:
        (i)cd backend
        (ii)python manage.py runserver

        Important => So at this point you will notice you have 2 server running one at port 3000
        and other at port 8000, they are respectively react and django servers

    Creating New Django App with name programmers
        (i)python manage.py startapp programmers
        (ii) new programmers folder is now created with files, models, views, etc
        (iii) adding app to settings.py file
        (iv) 'programmers.apps.ProgrammersConfig', added this line in settings.py inside INSTALLED_APPS

    Little bit recap,
        (i) So in django we have 2 types of views function, function base views that we learnt at code insitite
        (ii) Class base views that we haven't learnt yet
        (iii) So difference is class base view are advance and there are so many things that get 
                configured automatically in class base views but we might not able to see flow
                of logic in class base view so we are goign to use function base views

    Creating new funciton in djagno progammers folder.
        (i)importing JsonResponse => from django.http import JsonResponse
        (ii)creating a dummy route for testing and seeing functioning later on this view
            will be of no use
        (iii)def getRoutes(request):
                return JsonResponse('Helloe', safe=False)
        (iv) above are the codes written in programmers.view and now adding new urls file inside programmers folder
        (v) adding refrence of programmers.urls in main settings url file
        (vi)starting django server to check views and urls working
    
    Creating new file in programmers.py inside python, programmers app 
        (i)Copy pasiting data from programer.js file inside frontend/src folder
        (ii)Removing const to convert json data into python dictinary
        (iii)removing last export default line
    
    Importing programmers.py file inside our views file
        (i) from .programmers import programmers
        (ii)def getProgrammers(request):
            return JsonResponse(programmers, safe=False))
        (iii)above is code inside programmers.view file 
        (iv) added that to programmers.urls.py so we can see data in browser
        (v)I can see data of programmers inside the browser no error.
